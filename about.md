Hi I'm Dane. I work for [HashiCorp][1] writing Go on their Cloud Services team.
For the 8 years prior to that I worked on a variety of teams at [Heroku][2] (API,
Internal Tools, Private Spaces). Before that some government contracting, and
before _that_, well that'd take you to my PHP and Perl days.

## What about my free time?

I teeter between video games and side projects. Writing code is my passion, but
when I want to mull over an idea, video games. These days it's [Destiny][3] on
PC and I was lucky enough to get [a private studio tour][4] back in 2017.
